MAZE USING REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
In this project we use the Bellman equation which uses the state value function which is based on the concept of Dynamic Programming.
                    V(s)=max(R(s,a)+ γV(s’))
V(s)=State value function of the current state
V(s')=State value function of the next state
R(s,a)=Reward obtained upon performing action a from state a
γ=Discount factor(It is a hyperparameter that determines the amount of importance we give to future rewards)
